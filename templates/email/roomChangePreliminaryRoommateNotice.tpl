{ROOMMATE},

This is a courtesy notice to inform you that University Housing will most likely assign another student as your roomate within the next 24-48 hours.

Please ensure that the vacant space in your room is available and presentable.

You will receive a follow-up email as soon as possible with further information; however, it is possible that you will not receive it until after your new roommate has moved in.
