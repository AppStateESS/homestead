Dear {NAME},

{REQUESTOR} has listed you as a preferred roommate for on-campus housing for {YEAR}.

Since there are a limited number of spaces for our returning students, on-campus housing availability is determined via a random selection process.  You are being sent this email because we do not have an application for you for {YEAR}.

If you want to be considered for on-campus housing for {YEAR}, you must complete the re-application process by going to: https://hms.appstate.edu/ and logging on with your AppalNet username and password.

If you have any questions about the re-application process, please refer to the housing FAQ: https://hms.appstate.edu/webpage/id/2

Sincerely,

Housing Assignments
