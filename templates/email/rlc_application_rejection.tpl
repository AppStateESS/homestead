Hello {NAME}, 

Thank for you for taking the time to apply for one of our Residential Learning Communities (RLCs) for {TERM}.  These unique housing options are a popular living option among our returning students.  At this time, I regret to inform you that your RLC application has not been accepted.

Because you are a returning student and you have submitted your housing application, you will still be placed in the general housing lottery where you will have the chance of being selected to live on campus for the next academic year.  Please make sure you are checking your email regularly, as email is how you will be notified if you have been selected for the lottery.   

We are sorry that we are unable to accept your RLC application at this time and wish you the best in your next year at Appalachian.  It truly is a great place to be!  If you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter, please call 828.262.2160. 

Best wishes, 
M. Corinne Smith
