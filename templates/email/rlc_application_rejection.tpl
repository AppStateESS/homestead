Hello {NAME},

Thank for you for taking the time to apply for one of our Residential
Learning Communities (RLCs) for {TERM}. These unique housing options
are a popular living option among our continuing and incoming students. At this time, I regret to inform you that your RLC application has not been accepted and you will not be invited to join an RLC.

Incoming freshman will be placed in their housing assignment by the Housing Assignment Office as part of the regular assignment process.  Transfer students who were assigned should already be aware of their placement.

All of the Housing Assignments will be released on July 15, 2013 via an email to your ASU email address with your placement, roommate, and move in dates.  Please make sure you are checking your email regularly, as email is how you will be notified about your placement.

We are sorry that we are unable to accept your RLC application at this
time and wish you the best in your next year at Appalachian. It truly
is a great place to be! If you have any questions or concerns regarding
this matter, please call 828.262.2160.

Best wishes,
Matt Zalman
Residence Life & Learning Communities Coordinator
Appalachian State University
