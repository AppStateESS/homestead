Hello {NAME},
 
Thank for you for taking the time to apply for one of our Residential
Learning Communities (RLCs) for {TERM}. These unique housing options
are a popular living option among our continuing and incoming students.
At this time, I regret to inform you that your RLC application has not
been accepted and you will not be invited to join an RLC.
 
Incoming freshmen will be placed in their housing assignment by the
Housing Assignment Office as part of the regular assignment process.
 
All of the Housing Assignments will be released mid-July via an email
to your Appalachian State University email address with your placement, roommate, and move-in
date and time.  Please make sure you are checking your email regularly,
as email is how you will be notified about your placement.
 
We are sorry that we are unable to accept your RLC application at this
time and wish you the best in your next year at Appalachian. It truly
is a great place to be! If you have any questions or concerns
regarding this matter, please call 828.262.2160.
 
Best wishes,
Tempest Bouknight-Davis
Coordinator of Residential Education
