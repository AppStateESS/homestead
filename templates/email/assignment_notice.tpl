If you are a new, incoming freshman receiving this notification, you have been assigned and are obligated to the terms and conditions of the University Housing Residence Hall License Contract.

According to Page 2, Section C in the Residence Hall License Contract, University Housing reserves the right to make consolidations and changes to room assignments if needed between now and July. Your official assignment will be sent to your ASU email address mid-July.
 
As an upper classman, if you find that you do not need on-campus housing for the upcoming year, please contact our department in writing by sending an email to uha@appstate.edu. Non-freshman students who cancel their contract between now and June 30, 2013 will be charged a non-refundable $250 administration fee. Non-freshman students who cancel their housing contract AFTER June 30, 2013 will be charged the FULL semester amount of the residence hall rate to their student account.
 
Please feel free to contact our office by email with any questions. You may view your assignment and checklist by visiting http://hms.appstate.edu.  We encourage you to check your ASU email and visit the Appalachian State University Housing Facebook page often for updated information from our department.

Sincerely,
