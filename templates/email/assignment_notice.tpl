Dear {NAME},

Welcome to Appalachian State University! University Housing is
preparing for your arrival in August and we look forward to
having you as a member of our residence hall community!

Your housing assignment information for {TERM} is listed below.


On-campus Housing Assignment Information
----------------------------------------
Assignment: {LOCATION}
<!-- BEGIN roommate_text -->
Roommates:
<!-- BEGIN roommates -->
            {ROOMMATE}
<!-- END roommates -->
<!-- END roommate_text -->

For students interested in room or roommate changes, we are unable to
accommodate these requests at this time due to current occupancy.
University Housing will allow room changes after the second week of
classes (pending availability). At that time, you can log into
https://hms.appstate.edu to submit a room change request, which will
be reviewed by your residence hall's staff.

<!-- BEGIN movein_time -->
Check-in Time: {MOVE_IN_TIME}
<!-- END movein_time -->

Unless you have been separately notified of a different move in time,
please follow the time noted above for your move in. Additional move
in information can be found by visiting our website:

*Note*: You may receive more than one housing assignment notification,
this indicates a change has been made in some way to your assignment
(room change, roommate change, etc.).  The most recent notification
overrides all previous notifications.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact our office
at 828-262-2160. You may also visit our website at:

Alicia Vest
