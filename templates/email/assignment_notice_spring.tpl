Reapplication is here!!!!!

Current on-campus students who are interested in living on campus again for the 2017-2018 academic
year must reapply for housing. Applications are available December 1, 2016 - January 31, 2017. Once a
student has applied for the reapplication process invitations will be sent via email in February and allow
groups of students to select a room and sign a Residence Hall License Contract until all available spaces
are filled. Students should be checking their Appalachian State University email regularly during
February for updates on their status in the reapplication process. Please visit the Reapplication page at:
http://housing.appstate.edu/reapp for further information and frequently asked questions.
