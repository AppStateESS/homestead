{NAME},

Welcome to {HALL_NAME}! You've been checked-in to {ASSIGNMENT}.

It's important for your safety that we have your most up-to-date emergency contact information. Please review the contacts listed on the attached Resident Information Card. If anything is missing or incorrect, log in at <https://hms.appstate.edu> to make changes. 


Also on the attached Resident Information Card is a list of existing damages to your room. You will receive a form at your first floor meeting where you may list any additional damages you've found so those damages can be added to your Resident Information Card. Turn the form in at your hall's front desk between 8pm and midnight before midnight on Friday, August 22, 2014. You will be financially responsible for all damages which are not recorded on indicated on your Resident Information Card.


If you have any questions about University Housing, your Residence Hall, or about Appalachian in general, your RA is a great person to ask! We wish you a happy semester!

Sincerely,  
University Housing
