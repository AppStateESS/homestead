{NAME},

Welcome to {HALL_NAME}! You've been checked-in to {ASSIGNMENT}.

It's important for your safety that we have your most up-to-date emergency contact information. Please review the contacts listed on the attached Resident Information Card. If anything is missing or incorrect, log in at https://hms.appstate.edu to make changes.


The Resident Information Card is also used for tracking damages to your room. You need to log into the Housing Management System (at https://hms.appstate.edu) where you may list any damages you've found in your room so those damages can be added to your Resident Information Card. Complete the form within 7 days of this email. After that time, you will be financially responsible for all damages which are not indicated on your Resident Information Card.


If you have any questions about University Housing, your Residence Hall, or about Appalachian in general, your RA is a great person to ask! We wish you a happy semester!

Sincerely,
University Housing
