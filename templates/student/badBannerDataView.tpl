            <div><strong>Your student data has not been fully processed though the University's computer system yet. Because of this, the Housing Management System doesn't have all the information it needs about you. It may take up to three days after your Admissions acceptance deposit is received before your data will be fully processed. Your housing assignment will not be affected by how soon you apply. Please be patient and try again later.<br /><br />
            If you continue to receive this message after five days from submitting your deposit or you are not an incoming freshmen student, please {CONTACT_LINK}.
