        Welcome to Appalachian State University Housing and Residence Life. The Department of Housing and Residence Life 
        is pleased you have chosen Appalachian and look forward to meeting your housing needs. We see that you are a transfer student
        admitted for the {ENTRY_TERM} semester and will be living on-campus for the first time. 
        <br /> <br />
        As a transfer student, you should be aware of your housing options. Transfer students may apply for housing; however, remember that housing is not guaranteed for transfer students. 
        Very few transfer students are selected for on-campus housing.  You will be notified by mid July if you are going to get on-campus housing.
        Housing is offered to all new freshmen and then priority is given to returning students, and lastly transfer students. Transfer students are selected based on the date the deposit and housing application 
        are received.  Housing on campus is very limited; therefore you are encouraged to explore off-campus housing options. We recommend visiting University Highlands at their web site:  <a href="http://www.universityhighlands.com/">www.universityhighlands.com</a>, 
        as an off-campus option.  If you have any questions please visit our web site at: <a href="http://housing.appstate.edu/">www.housing.appstate.edu</a>.
