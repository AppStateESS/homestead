        Welcome to Appalachian State University Housing and Residence Life. The Department of Housing and Residence Life 
        is pleased you have chosen Appalachian and look forward to meeting your housing needs. We see that you are a new freshmen
        admitted for the <strong>{ENTRY_TERM}</strong> semester and will be living on-campus for the first time.
        <br />
        You are required to apply for housing for the following terms:
        
        <ul>
            <!-- BEGIN REQUIRED_TERMS -->
            <li>{REQ_TERM}</li>
            <!-- END REQUIRED_TERMS -->
        </ul>
        <br />
        Once you have completed an application for these terms, you may be eligible to apply for on-campus housing for additional terms.
        <br />
