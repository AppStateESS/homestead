    <p>This is an additional application for Residential Learning Communities. To learn more about the different options available to you please visit the <a href="http://housing.appstate.edu/pagesmith/29" target="_blank">Residential Learning Communities website</a>.</p> 

    <p>Those students interested in the Heltzer Honors Program, Watauga Global Community, or the Academy of Science please note your interest below.  In addition to this application, you must also fill out a separate application for these communities.  Please apply for membership to any of these programs -- the <a href="http://www.honors.appstate.edu/" target="_blank">Honors Program</a>, <a href="http://wataugaglobal.appstate.edu/" target="_blank">Watauga Global Community</a>, or the <a href="http://housing.appstate.edu/pagesmith/34" target="_blank">Academy of Science</a> -- on their websites.</p> 

    <p>Students interested in the Academy of Science will automatically qualify for a scholarship upon acceptance into the community.  However, applications to both the Academy's RLC and the Academy of Science Scholarship program must be completed before a student is considered for membership.</p>

    <p style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 3px; background: #F5F5F5"><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot be accepted into a learning community with a pre-chosen roommate who does not apply to the same community.  In addition, once you apply, you can no longer choose roommates who have not applied to the same community.</p>
