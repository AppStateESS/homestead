            In order to select your roommate please provide their Appalachian State University email address below.<br /><br />
            You will receive a follow-up email verifying the status of your invitation and your requested roommate will receive an email inviting them to confirm your request.<br /><br />
            You will also receive an email once the individual accepts or rejects your invitation.<br /><br />
            It is <b>NOT</b> necessary for the person you are inviting to also invite you. They only need to accept your invitation and you will be paired with this individual.<br /><br />

            <b>Note: </b>If you have been accepted as a member of a Residential Learning Community or a Common Interest Housing group you will only be able to choose a roommate who has also been accepted into the same group.<br /><br />
