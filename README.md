# Mr. Developer:

**To you, who has been tasked with finishing this bootstrap, here are some tips:**

 * The main template file is `templates/hms.tpl` *duh*

 * I think you will need to bootstrap all 10 million template files. I made a menu and bootstrapped the first page.





### Changes I made that may need another look

 * The `templates/user.tpl` and `templates/guest.tpl` are now identical. Could find a way to remove one. The menubar handles the differences in priveleges.

 * The footer is like 10-20px above the bottom of the page. I can't for the life of me figure out where the style causing that is coming from. Not a biggie, just annoying as F***.
